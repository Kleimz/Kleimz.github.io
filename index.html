  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="Thumbnails/mig-removebg-preview.png" alt="Picture of me" class="about-image"/>
  <p>Hi, my name is Markus and i love games so much that i spent five years of my life becoming a master of science in engineering, specifically in game development and learning technology.
    When i was around six or seven, I started playing Diablo 2 and Counter-Strike 1.6. These two games laid the foundation for my love of FPS, ARPG and Action-Adventure games. I am always drawn
  towards action and exploration - both in games and real life - and although i have a quiet personality, i really want to share my passion for adventure with others.

My dream job is one where get to make cool things, while having experienced colleagues to support me and teach me how to get even better.</p>

    <div class="details">
      <div class="about">
        <p>Still in very early days, This First person Puzzle Shooter inspired by counter-strike, 007 Nightfire and the Hitman franchise. 
          You play as a covert operative tasked with infiltrating the hideouts of powerful crime bosses, dictators and the like, who have been deemed too dangerous to live. 
          To complete missions you must remain undetected by taking out guards faster than they can sound the alarm. 
          Currently the guards can be taken out through headshots, collateral headshots and ricochet headshots.

    <h2 class="title">Master's Thesis</h2>
    <div class="details">
      <div class="about">
        <p>This project was made in collaboration with Terrariet Reptile Zoo, Vissenbjerg, Denmark. The original idea was to create a real-life pokedex for the zoo via image recognition.
         At the end of the project, it contained informational content and minigames for seven animals at the zoo and the final grade was an A.

    <h2 class="title">Bachelor Project - level design cues</h2>
    <div class="details">
      <div class="about">
    <p>
      I designed and programmed everything in this project myself except for some objects, the music and minor use of AI-generated images.
      The purpose of the project was to teach level design through a narrative-driven playable game. The scope was later reduced to teach about some visual cues to guide the player.
      Note: There is a bug with the "back" button on the controls menu of the build and it only works when visibly highlighted.

    <h2 class="title">Multiplayer Brawler Racing Game</h2>
    <div class="details">
      <div class="about">
    <p>
      This project was developed with fellow students at SDU and was our first multiplayer game. The game was inspired by Mario Kart and Wreckfest but also includes brawler elements by awarding points for the destruction of other players' cars.
      I played a big role in designing mechanics, especially the paper prototype, programming various mechanics and adding features to the track. The paper prototype was made as a boardgame, where number of tiles moved and weapon accuracy was determined by dice rolls.
